Research about
	- Fancy LaTeX techniques
	- GDT/LDT/IDT
	- Memory Management
		- Physical
			- buddy?
			- bitmaps?
			- Both?
			- Best implementation practices
		- Virtual
			- How GTD Works
			- How to do that whole "page" shebang
			- MMU, TLB

		- Is *my* enum-based bitmap the same as the stadard bitmap out there?

Implement
	- Docs about research
	- GDT/LDT/IDT handling
	- Physical memory management/allocator
		- [MAYBE] bump
		- Enum/bitmap
		- buddy

	- [CLOUDY] vm


Philosophy
	- How many different allocation frontends?
		- Kernel only "bitmap" allocator with 640KiB budget
			- Should it be page based? Should it be directly off of the physical pool (prbl. not)
				* Maybe just permanently allocate some area with the buddy.
		- Should I have a bump allocator, or will the bitmap allocator be enough?
